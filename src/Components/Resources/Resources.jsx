                    Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.

                      There are different types of stress. The type of stress
                      experienced depends on how often the individual is exposed
                      to the stressors and how long the stress symptoms last.

                      Stress is measured in two main ways: self-report scales
                      and physiological tests.<br></br>
                      Self-report scales rely on participants to answer
                      questions honestly to measure stress levels.

                        The Social Readjustment Rating Scale lists potential
                        stressors to which values are assigned (a numerical
                        value indicates how stressful the stressor is).

                        scale was developed to determine how everyday annoyances
